:bf:So what's it gonna be this time?
:bf:Are you gonna get all corrupted?
:bf:Are you gonna randomly kill a bunch of people?
:bf:Are you gonna crucify me again?
:dad:Nice fourth wall break.
:dad:That is supposed to be my job, though. Oh well.
:dad:I see no reason to get angry at a disproportionate blue-haired midget and his obviously mentally-inefficient girlfriend.

:dad:Go-go-gadget Odd Time Signature.
